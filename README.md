# Psychic-Game
I had help from my new tutor, Isabel Arcones. When I contacted her, I had pseudo-coded the entire game, but was having trouble understanding the syntax and how to begin. She gave me some helpful details on defining variables first; understanding which functions to use; and the IF/ELSE loops. THe game was functional except for a few items--discovered by my 12 year-old perfectionist--which TA Dave and Phil helped solve... I've noted those spots on the JS doc: reuse of letters/corresponding math functions, and excluding keys from key-press events.

I also used "Javascript For Kids: A Playful Introduction to Programming" to better understand syntax used during class lectures, W3's Javascript sections, YouTube videos, Wikipedia, Srtackoverflow, and the Eloquent web site... still trying to figure out syntax and capabilities. Was thinking about running a for-loop in this program or a WHILE condition, but was talked out of it by Isabel and Phil. TWICE. So I accept it wasn't the best solution given where I had already made progress.
